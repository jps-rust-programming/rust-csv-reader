## Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>

In Rust, using `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>` is a common pattern for error handling when you want to return a result that can encapsulate any `error` type.

## Breakdown

- ### Result Type:

The Result type is an enum that represents either success `(Ok)` or failure `(Err)`.
In `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>`, the Ok variant contains (), which means the function returns nothing on success.

- ### Box<dyn Error>:

Box<dyn Error> is a `heap-allocated` trait object that can hold any type that implements the `Error` trait.
This allows you to return various error types without needing to specify them all explicitly.

## Key Points

- `Error Propagation`: The `?` operator is used to propagate errors. If an error occurs, it automatically returns Err(e) from the function.
- `Handling Multiple Error Types`: Using `Box<dyn Error>` allows for flexibility in the types of errors that can be returned, which is especially useful in functions that may deal with different libraries or error types.
